## Lessons Learned

This project helped to familiarize myself with state menager [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), the UI library [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) and [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) mainly. <br/>
I was able to practice clean code and architecture making this tool. The most challenging task was to do as much componentization as possible. <br/>
I also found out cool libs like [react-colorful](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-colorful) and [circletype](https://circletype.labwire.ca/) that worth mention.<br/>
